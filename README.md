# Assignment-Task-Management-System

This project provides a platform for teachers and students to efficiently manage the assignments given throughout the engineering process. This project focuses on isolating the job of assigning assignments and their submissions to a single environment so that students do not have to waste time in fetching assignments from others or from mails and can have smooth functioning submission process.

Introduction:
	Nowadays, teachers distribute assignments via mail or by dictating the problems in class. Also sometimes they are displayed on notice boards, about which not all students know. This leads to multiple sources of information and thus reduces the reliability of the same. In such cases, the students get delayed in acquiring the assignments and hence get lesser amount of time to complete them.  

Scope: 
	This project has a wide ranging scope where every education system can employ this method to create an efficient assignment delivery and submission collection system. 
	This project can also be used to outsource projects and problem statements to freelance developers.
